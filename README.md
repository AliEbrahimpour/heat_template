Automation examples for Openstack using the HEAT templating language

## What is HEAT?
HEAT is Openstack's template-driven orchestration engine. It allows
users to define servers, networks, storage etc as "YAML"
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)  templates which
can then be deployed as "Stacks" to create complex systems which are
scalable, repeatable and automatable.
See: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat for more info on what HEAT is.
